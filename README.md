# Overview

{I want to add another language to my list, and be able to understand rust code if given to me.}

{I wrote some really useless code just to get a grip on what Rust really is.}

{This was mostly eduational.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
